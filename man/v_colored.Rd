\title{Assign a color to each node of a network depending of a certain taxonomic level,
for example, the phylum.}
\usage{
v_colored(g, T_table, g_tax, p_tax, g_colors)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{An igraph object.}

\item{T_table}{Taxa table as data.frame.}

\item{g_tax}{The taxonomic level at which the nodes will be colored.}

\item{p_tax}{The taxonomic level at which the network was built.}

\item{g_colors}{Set of colors. The vector must have the same length of g_tax elements.}
}
\value{
An igraph object.

# Load this library to create a vector with colors

# Nodes will be colored by Family, and the net was built by Order
